1. Introduction                         *Ultimate-Test-Utility-Intro* 

|Ultimate-Test-Utility| is the only tool you'll need for creating and running
unit tests in Vim. Unit testing has been notoriously hard for Vim-script and
the plugins that do exist often require languages, are difficult to
setup/configure/use, have bugs, or have incomplete documentation.

|Ultimate-Test-Utility| is maintained solely by Kevin Biskar and is constantly
expanding it's features. If you have any feature requests, concerns, or have
found any undocumented bugs, please notify him (me).

2. Features                      *Ultimate-Test-Utility-Features* 

|Ultimate-Test-Utility| is written solely in vimscript so compilation
requirements are minimal.
|Ultimate-Test-Utility| provides several levels of reporting so your reports
are as detailed or minimal as you'd like.
|Ultimate-Test-Utility| allows for easy installation through Pathogen, Vundle,
or other compatible plugin managers.

separate test functions. See |Ultimate-Test-Utility-Config| for more details.
|Ultimate-Test-Utility| is, like most vim plugins, free! Feel free to
distribute, contribute, modify or spread the word.
