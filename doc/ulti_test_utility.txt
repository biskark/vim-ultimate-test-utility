==============================================================================
1. Introduction                      *Ultimate-Test-Utility-Intro* 

|Ultimate-Test-Utility| is the only tool you'll need for creating and running
unit tests in Vim. Unit testing has been notoriously hard for Vim-script and
the plugins that do exist often require languages, are difficult to
setup/configure/use, have bugs, or have incomplete documentation.

|Ultimate-Test-Utility| is maintained solely by Kevin Biskar and is constantly
expanding it's features. If you have any concerns, feature requests, or have
found any undocumented bugs, please notify him (me).


==============================================================================
2. Features and Requirements          *Ultimate-Test-Utility-Features* 

- |Ultimate-Test-Utility| is written solely in vimscript so compilation
  requirements are minimal.

    - However, |Ultimate-Test-Utility| must be run in a Vim 7.0 or higher and
      some functions may require read/write access to files you may be using.
      Of course, use those functions with care, though the instances in which
      these precautions are necessary should be obvious; |Ultimate-Test-Utility| 
      does NOT want to harm your work, it's here to help.

    - Also, |Ultimate-Test-Utility| has included some example functions that
      may not work correctly on your OS. This should not be an issue when
      using this plugin to write your own vimscript code, only when trying the
      demos. In the future, these examples may be updated to be compatible with
      as many OSes and setups as possible.

- |Ultimate-Test-Utility| provides several levels of reporting so your reports
  are as detailed or minimal as you'd like.

- |Ultimate-Test-Utility| allows for easy installation through Pathogen, Vundle,
  or other compatible plugin managers. If you're reading this, it's likely
  installed correctly already, but if not consult the README.md file.

- |Ultimate-Test-Utility| is flexible and supports both inline testing or
  creating separate test functions. Both techniques can be customized easily
  for development and distribution versions with minimal hassle. See
  |Ultimate-Test-Utility-Config| and |Ultimate-Test-Utility-Extended-Examples| 
  for more details.

- |Ultimate-Test-Utility| is, like most vim plugins, open-source! Please feel
  free to distribute, contribute, modify or spread the word.


==============================================================================
3. Usage                              *Ultimate-Test-Utility-Usage*

|Ultimate-Test-Utility| has a straightforward API, and is not unlike the Perl
testing suite. However, Vim's lack of out-of-box OOP and our decision to
maximize compatibility (we don't use other languages or CLI testing
software) means that |Ultimate-Test-Utility| does have a mild
learning-curve, but should be easy to pick for both testing veterans and
first-timers alike.

The first section, |Ultimate-Test-Utility-Quick-Start|, provides a quick
overview of how to use this plugin.

The second section, |Ultimate-Test-Utility-Basic-Examples|, shows the most
common usage and should be enough to get you started on working on your own
projects.

The third section, |Ultimate-Test-Utility-Basic-Examples|, explores more
complex usage cases and explains the interface to some of the less intuitive
functions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3a. Quick Start Guide                 *Ultimate-Test-Utility-Quick-Start*

|Ultimate-Test-Utility| breaks down tests into two categories. Individual
Assertion tests (referred to as sub-tests) which check for one specific thing,
and groupings of related sub-tests (collectively referred to as a test).
It's often natural to have sub-tests in a full test address different aspects
and edge cases of a particular function or key mapping. Thus a plugin with 4
functions and 1 keymapping may have 5 total "tests", with each "test"
consisting of up to dozens of "sub-tests."

The basic workflow is simple.
1. You MUST call |UltiTestStart| to tell vim that you are going into
   "test-mode".
2. You then call as many |UltiAssert...| sub-tests as you need.
3. You then call |UltiTestStop| to tell vim that a particular test is over.
4. You may then call |UltiTestReport| which will give a report of varying
   detail about the success and failure of your sub-tests. Additionally, this
   will report the overall success of the entire test. The degree of detail
   reported is dependent on the value of |g:ulti_test_verbose|. See
   |Ultimate-Test-Utility-Config| for more details.
5. If you wish to execute more tests (ie. more groupds of sub-tests), you
   should call |UltiTestReset|.
6. Repeat steps 1-6 as needed.
7. You may then call |UltiTestFinalSummary| to give a simple summary of all
   the "tests" you have run (since you either loaded the plugin or called
   |UltiTestResetAll|, see next step for details).
8. If you wish to run another suite of "tests", say for a different plugin or
   file, call |UltiTestResetAll|.
9. Repeat steps 1-8 as needed.

The next section shows how to setup and run one full "test" on an example
function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3b. Basic Examples                    *Ultimate-Test-Utility-Basic-Examples*

Special Note: It's good practice to write your tests before you write the code
you're testing, but for the purpose of this tutorial, we'll ignore that.

Example Multiply function, takes two arguments and returns the quotient. >

    function! Multiply(numerator, denominator)
        return a:numerator * a:denominator
    endfunction

Example test function that examines some basic-use cases and possible edge
cases. Comments have been sprinkled in to explain a little of the API. >
    
    function! MultiplyTestOne()
        call UltiTestStart()

        call UltiAssertTrue('', Multiply(2, 2) == 4, 'true')

        call UltiAssertTrue("Testing 1 times 1 isn't 6",
                    \ Multiply(1, 1) == 6,
                    \ 'false')

        " We're deliberately making an incorrect test here to see what happens
        call UltiAssertTrue("Testing 5 times -2 isn't -10",
                    \ Multiply(5, -2) == -10,
                    \ 'false')

        call UltiAssertEquals('Testing Multiply(2.0, 3) == Multiply(3.0, 2)',
                    \ Multiply(2.0, 3),
                    \ Multiply(3.0, 2),
                    \ 'true')

        call UltiTestStop()
        call UltiTestReport()
    endfunction

    " Now to run the test
    call MultiplyTestOne()

This should give something like the following as output: >

    Sub-test 3: Failed, Testing 5 times -2 isn't -10
    Test 1 Results:
        Expected: Not specified, Passed: 3, Failed: 1, Skipped: 0

Yay, it works, let's review what we did.

The calls to |UltiTestStart|, |UltiTestStop|, and |UltiTestReport| were covered in
the previous section and are straightforward. However, we then called the
actual sub-tests themselves.

Each sub-test available starts with 'UltiAssert'.
Each UltiAssert function has a slightly different argument signature but there
are some similarities in usage.
1. The first argument is a string describing the purpose of the test. Notice
   this message was displayed when sub-test 3 failed. Descriptive messages
   make pin-pointing problems quick, but you may provide an empty string like
   we did for the first sub-test.
2. Next are the arguments unique to the assertion test being run.
3. The last argument is optional, and can only be the string 'skip' to
   indicate that you don't want to run the test at this time. Notice that we
   did not use this feature in any of the tests we just ran.
4. The argument before 'skip' (aka the last argument if you don't
   provide 'skip'), must be either 'true' or 'false', indicating if
   the Assertion is expected to be true or false.

Essentially, each |UltiAssert...| looks like this... >
    call UltiAssertWhatever(description, ..., expected_outcome)  " or
    call UltiAssertWhatever(description, ..., expected_outcome, 'skip')
where the '...' is unique to whatever test you're using.

Note that in MultiplyTestOne we used |UltiAssertTrue|, which took one unique
argument (the result of the Multiply function call) and |UltiAssertEquals| which
took two unique arguments (the results of two Multiply function calls). As you
may have guessed, |UltiAssertTrue| simply evaluates the truthiness of its one
unique argument, and |UltiAssertEquals| compares its two unique arguments to
eachother.  Most sub-tests can be written with either one of these. The
presence of both of them, and the more specific assertions explained in the
next section, is merely a convenience. You should use whichever sub-tests feel
the most natural.

Next Steps:
Yay, it works ... but it could be better. Ignoring that our function is
trivial, we deliberately made a mistake, and the usefulness of these tests is
questionable, we can still improve our test function.

1. If we run our test again, it now says we're on Test 2 even though this
   is the same test we just ran.

2. 'Test 1' isn't a horribly informative name in the first place.

3. Though moot in this case, how do we know we tested everything we
   intended? Though careful coding can eliminate this problem, in tests with
   many sub-tests, especially in more complicated plugins, we may want an
   extra level of confidence.

It turns out we can fix all of these problems with minimal effort. >


    function! MultiplyTestTwo()
        call UltiTestReset()
        call UltiTestStart('Testing the Multiply Function', 4)

        call UltiAssertTrue('', Multiply(2, 2) == 4, 'true')

        call UltiAssertTrue("Testing 1 times 1 isn't 6",
                    \ Multiply(1, 1) == 6,
                    \ 'false')

        " We're deliberately making an incorrect test here to see what happens
        call UltiAssertTrue("Testing 5 times -2 isn't -10",
                    \ Multiply(5, -2) == -10,
                    \ 'false')

        call UltiAssertEquals('Testing Multiply(2.0, 3) == Multiply(3.0, 2)',
                    \ Multiply(2.0, 3),
                    \ Multiply(3.0, 2),
                    \ 'true',
                    \ 'skip')

        call UltiTestStop()
        call UltiTestReport()
    endfunction

    " Now to run the test
    call MultiplyTestOne()

This should give something like the following as output: >

    Sub-test 3: Failed, Testing 5 times -2 isn't -10
    Test 1 'Testing the Multiply Function' Results:
        Expected: 4, Passed: 2, Failed: 1, Skipped: 1

Two quick points, and we can move on to more advanced usage.

1. The call to |UltiTestReset| tells vim to reset our sub-test counters so
   that we could have been placed at the end of the function instead of the
   beginning. However, as we'll see, this call should usually be made outside
   of any one test, and rather after or before running a suite of tests.

2. The call to |UltiTestStart| can take two optional arguments in any order.
   It can take a string that should describe how the sub-tests are related,
   and an integer that tells the test how many sub-tests to expect.

3. The last sub-test has the 'skip' argument added, just to show how to use
   it. Note that adding 'skip' only prevents the result from being factored in
   the testing facility, it won't prevent any errors in the other arguments
   from causing problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3c. Extended Examples                 *Ultimate-Test-Utility-Extended-Examples*

Let's broaden our look at this plugin be testing some more complicated
plugins/functions and integrating several tests into one suite. Assume all
references to MultiplyTest() refer to the MultiplyTestTwo() function from the
previous section.

Special Note: It's good practice to write your tests before you write the code
you're testing, but for the purpose of this tutorial, we'll ignore that.

First let's write two more functions and add a keymapping for one of them.

The first is a slightly trickier function that echos the quotient of two
numbers rather than merely returns them. Also, divide by zero exceptions may
be thrown and we'll show how to deal with that. >

    function! Divide(numerator, denominator)
        if a:denominator == 0
            throw "Divide by zero"
        endif
        echo (a:numerator / a:denominator)
    endfunction

The next is a vim function that inserts the word "Hello" into the current
buffer. For convenience, we'll also add a helper function that adds a
keymapping for this function. >

    function! InsertHello()
        execute 'normal! iHello'
    endfunction

    function! NewMapping()
        nnoremap <silent> <leader>S :call tests#test_the_tests#InsertHello()<cr>
    endfunction


Ok, now let's write those tests. >

    function! TestDivide()
        call UltiTestStart("Divide Tests", 5)
        
        " Simple tests
        call UltiAssertTrue('6 / 2 == 3', Divide(6, 2) == 3, 'true')
        call UltiAssertTrue("1 / 3 == 0 ('Testing Int Division')",
                    \ Divide(1, 3) == 6, 'false')

        " Exception tests
        call UltiAssertException("Throws divide by zero error",
                    \ 'Divide by zero', 'Divide', [4, 0], 'true')
        call UltiAssertException("Doesn't throw divide by zero error",
                    \ 'Divide by zero', 'Divide', [4, 2], 'false')
        call UltiAssertException("Complains about arguments",
                    \ 'xxxxxxx', 'Divide', [], 'true')

        call UltiTestStop()
        call UltiTestReport()
    endfunction

Notes:
1. We still use the simple |UltiAssertTrue| for the simple edge cases.
2. |UltiAssertException| follows the same pattern as the other |UltiAssert|
   functions.
3. However, |UltiAssertException| has some pecularities too. It has 3
   mandatory arguments in addition to the regular ones.
   1. The error you're checking for. It can be a vim style regex.
   2. The name of the function you're testing AS A STRING. Do NOT call
      this function directly.
   3. Any arguments you want to pass to the function must be submitted as a
      list. If no arguments are to be passed, you must still specify an empty
      list. (See Sub-test 5). >


This next test is a bit of a cheat in that it tests the InsertHello() function
via the keymapping where these tests should probably be separate. Also, the
use of the mapleader variable can be troublesome because the mapping is always
whatever the value of the leader key at the time it was set. If this doesn't
make sense to you, just know to be careful if you use it. >

    function! TestInsertHello()
        call UltiTestStart('Testing Command Mapping and Text Insertion', 3)

        if exists('mapleader')
            let leader = mapleader
        else
            let leader = '\'
        endif

        " Make the new mapping
        call NewMapping()

        call UltiAssertInBuffer('Testing for "Hello" absence before execute',
                    \ 'Hello', 'false')

        execute 'normal! ' . leader . 'S'
        call UltiAssertInBuffer('Testing for "Hello" absence after normal!',
                    \ 'Hello', 'false')

        execute 'normal ' . leader . 'S'
        call UltiAssertInBuffer('Testing for "Hello World" presence after normal',
                    \ 'Hello', 'true')
        
        " Clean up the text that was just inserted. Not necessary for the
        " test though.
        execute "s/Hello//"

        call UltiTestStop()
        call UltiTestReport()
    endfunction

Notes
1. We specified there should be 3 sub-tests run and given the test a
   description.
2. We have not called |UltiTestReset| yet.
3. Now that we're executing more complicated functions, we need
   to be careful that we're not polluting the current buffer with side-effects
   from our testing. In particular beware of testing |UltiAssertInBuffer|
   sub-tests in the buffer where you wrote the test. See if you can figure out
   why.
4. |UltiAssertInBuffer| has an almost identical interface to |UltiAssertTrue|.


Finally, let's organize these two tests into a full suite with the
MultiplyTest from before. Take out the call to |UltiTestReset| in the
MultiplyTest. >

    function! AllTests()
        call UltiTestReset()         " Clears residual junk

        call MultiplyTest()
        call TestDivide()
        call TestInsertHello()

        call UltiTestFinalSummary()  " Brief summary of all three tests
        call UltiTestResetAll()      " Clears everything
    endfunction

Now to call the whole thing... >

    call AllTests()

You can change the output by setting one of these three values before you call
the function. >

    let g:ulti_test_verbose = 0    " or
    let g:ulti_test_verbose = 1    " or
    let g:ulti_test_verbose = 2

Assuming you left it at 1, you should get ... >
